## About this project

This project focuses on use of `knockout.js` framework and 3rd party APIs to develop single page application featuring a map of a neighbourhood with highlighted locations, 3rd-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

## Content

For this project I selected my home city of Vienna, and added several points of interest. To include 3rd-party information about those locations I used `Wikipedia API`.

The application is visually very simple and does not include many locations, since the main focus of this project was on the use of `knockout.js` and APIs.
